<p>Hi! Just in case, here's how to login as an admin! The admin's username is admin, and its password is adminpassword.
  You can also log in as a regular user using "user1" and "user1password", as well as "user2" and "user2password". This pattern continues. 
You can also log in as an admin with the TA username & password.   </p>
